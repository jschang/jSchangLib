First, the license is LGPLv3 and the product is currently incomplete.

This project was intended to be a stock trading agent
which would use a genetic algorithm to determine the
optimal set of network inputs for training a feed-forward
neural network.  The feed forward network would, naturally,
output a "Buy" or "Sell" signal.

I got pretty far, I think, but there is still a massive amount of 
work to be done.

For a while I thought I'd just keep it to myself, 
but I'm interested to see if anyone can use it as a base
and, perhaps, kick me some ends if they can make it work.
